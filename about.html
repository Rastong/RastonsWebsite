    <h2>So you want to know about me, huh?</h2>
    <p>Well lemme tell you a tale of the fabled Sir Grizzel D. Brand. When he was a young boy, he lost his father due to war. He grew up with anger and hatred, but all he wanted really was to create a world of peace. He knew though in order to make peace, he must become what he hates, so the the world will learn peace. With his ideals in his head and fire in his heart, he sets off on his journey. He learns of people who are destroy the world. He knows that this is his responsibility to take care of. Grizzel D.Brand finds a group of mitfits to join him on his quest. However this stroy has nothing to do with me, besides it is the origin story of my dungeons and dragons character.</p>
